ABOUT
=====================================

Column {data-width=600 .left-align}
-------------------------

#### Introduction

In this project, we explore soccer statistics from multiple professional football leagues using data from FBref (https://fbref.com/en/comps), a trusted site for advanced football analytics. While we initially focused on Major League Soccer (MLS), we extended our analysis to include other major international competitions such as the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, and Serie A.

Our goal was to collect and organize standardized squad-level statistics across leagues to support comparative analysis. Specifically, we targeted the "Squad Standard Stats" tables on each competition’s main stats page. These tables contain information on team performance metrics such as matches played, goals, assists, average age, possession %, and more.

#### Method

We chose this dataset primarily out of personal interest: one of us enjoys following global football news, while the other is an avid FC25 player. Beyond our curiosity, we recognized that this data offers a rich opportunity for cross-league comparisons.

By scraping the same type of statistics from each league, we aimed to answer questions such as:

- Do older squads tend to score more goals, or is it the opposite? 
- Which leagues exhibit the highest goal efficiency? 
- Do teams with a higher discipline score tend to have fewer goals conceded? 
- Have teams overperformed or underperformed according to the expected stats?  
- Do possession-heavy teams always score more? 


These questions open the door for future data visualizations (like scatterplots or heatmaps) and statistical modeling (e.g., regression of goals on age or possession).

Conclusion 
==========================

Column {data-width = 200}
-------------------------

## Takeaways

- Older squads often correlate with higher scoring efficiency.  
- Possession percentage has a variable relationship with goals.  
- Top-performing teams consistently outscore their league averages.

## Next Steps

1. Build regression models per league.  
2. Incorporate expected goals (xG).  
3. Add time-series analysis across seasons.
